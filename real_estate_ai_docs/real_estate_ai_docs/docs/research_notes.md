# Research Notes for Real Estate AI Platform

## LangChain and LangGraph

LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with language models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows. It includes components such as document loaders, text splitters, chains, memory components, and LLM components.

LangGraph extends LangChain to build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Key features include:

- Control, moderation, and guidance of agent actions
- Expressive and customizable agent workflows (single, multi-agent, hierarchical, sequential)
- Persisted context for long-term interactions
- First-class streaming support for better UX design

LangGraph is particularly valuable for complex tasks that require reliability and control, making it suitable for our real estate AI platform that needs to handle multilingual interactions and complex analytics.

## Langfuse Observability

Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that provides observability and tracing capabilities for LLM applications. Key features include:

- Full context capture: Tracking complete execution flow including API calls, context, prompts, parallelism
- Cost monitoring: Tracking model usage and costs across the application
- Quality insights: Collecting user feedback and identifying low-quality outputs
- Dataset creation: Building high-quality datasets for fine-tuning and testing
- Root cause analysis: Quickly identifying and debugging issues in complex LLM applications

Langfuse supports nested traces that help understand what is happening and identify the root cause of problems in complex LLM applications. This will be essential for monitoring our multilingual chatbot and analytics components.

## pgvector for PostgreSQL

pgvector is an open-source vector similarity search extension for PostgreSQL that allows storing vectors with the rest of the data. Key features include:

- Support for exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- Support for single-precision, half-precision, binary, and sparse vectors
- Distance functions: L2 distance, inner product, cosine distance, L1 distance, Hamming distance, and Jaccard distance
- ACID compliance, point-in-time recovery, JOINs, and other PostgreSQL features

For our platform, pgvector will be used to store and query embeddings (vector 1536) for semantic search capabilities in the real estate domain. It supports index types like HNSW and IVFFlat for approximate nearest neighbor search, which can significantly improve query performance.

## UAE PDPL Compliance

The UAE Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 on Personal Data Protection (PDPL) establishes a comprehensive framework for data protection in the UAE. Key aspects include:

- Ensuring confidentiality of information and protecting privacy of individuals
- Rights for individuals to access, rectify, correct, delete, restrict processing, request cessation of processing or transfer of data
- Requirement for consent to be specific, informed, and unambiguous
- Establishment of the UAE Data Office as the data protection regulator
- Requirements for Data Protection Officers to ensure compliance

For our real estate platform, compliance with PDPL will be essential as we'll be handling personal data of users, leads, and property owners in the UAE.

## Bayut Leads API and Property Finder

Bayut is one of UAE's largest real estate portals with an audience of around 36 million people per year. The Bayut API helps to query real estate in UAE to create real estate applications.

Property Finder is another major real estate portal in the UAE with an audience of approximately 62 million people. The PF Expert API provides access to leads and property data.

These APIs will be integrated into our platform to provide comprehensive real estate data and lead management capabilities.

## DLD Open-Transactions API

The Dubai Land Department (DLD) provides an open-transactions API that contains comprehensive details about all types of real estate transactions in Dubai. This dataset includes all available columns related to property transactions.

Integration with this API will provide our platform with authoritative data on property transactions, enhancing the analytics and valuation capabilities of our system.
