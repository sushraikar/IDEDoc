## Decision Makers

- Solution Architect
- DevOps Engineer
- AI Engineer

## Context and Problem Statement

The Real Estate AI Operating System requires comprehensive observability to monitor, debug, and optimize the performance of AI components, particularly the multilingual chatbot and analytics services. We need to track LLM usage, costs, and performance while providing insights into user interactions. How should we implement observability for our AI components to ensure reliability, performance, and cost efficiency?

## Decision Drivers

- Need for LLM-specific observability
- Requirement to track costs and usage of AI services
- Ability to trace and debug complex AI workflows
- Performance monitoring requirements
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
- Compliance with UAE PDPL regulations

## Considered Options

- Option 1: General-purpose observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)
- Option 2: Langfuse for AI-specific observability
- Option 3: Custom observability solution built in-house

## Decision

Chosen option: "Option 2: Langfuse for AI-specific observability", because it provides specialized tools for LLM observability while integrating well with our existing monitoring infrastructure and offering features specifically designed for AI applications.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Purpose-built for LLM applications with features like trace visualization and cost tracking
- Seamless integration with LangChain and LangGraph
- Support for nested traces to understand complex AI workflows
- Ability to collect user feedback and identify low-quality outputs
- Dataset creation capabilities for fine-tuning and testing
- Open-source with self-hosting option for compliance with data residency requirements

### Negative

- Adds another tool to the monitoring stack
- Requires configuration and maintenance
- Team needs to learn a new observability tool
- May have limitations compared to more mature general-purpose tools

## Validation

The implementation will be validated through:
1. Monitoring of key metrics like response times, token usage, and costs
2. Tracing of complex conversation flows to identify bottlenecks
3. Analysis of user feedback correlated with AI responses
4. Regular review of observability data to drive improvements

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: General-purpose observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)

- Good, because they are mature and widely adopted
- Good, because the team may already have expertise with these tools
- Good, because they offer comprehensive monitoring capabilities
- Bad, because they lack LLM-specific features
- Bad, because they would require custom instrumentation for AI components
- Bad, because they don't provide specialized visualizations for LLM traces

### Option 2: Langfuse for AI-specific observability

- Good, because it's designed specifically for LLM applications
- Good, because it integrates seamlessly with LangChain and LangGraph
- Good, because it provides cost tracking and usage monitoring
- Good, because it supports nested traces for complex workflows
- Good, because it enables dataset creation for fine-tuning
- Neutral, because it's relatively new compared to general-purpose tools
- Bad, because it adds another tool to the monitoring stack

### Option 3: Custom observability solution built in-house

- Good, because it could be tailored exactly to our needs
- Good, because it would give complete control over the implementation
- Bad, because it would require significant development effort
- Bad, because it would need ongoing maintenance
- Bad, because it would delay the project timeline
- Bad, because it would duplicate functionality available in existing tools
