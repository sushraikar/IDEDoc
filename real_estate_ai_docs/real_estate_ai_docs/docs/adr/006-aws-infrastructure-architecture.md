## Context and Problem Statement

The Real Estate AI Operating System needs a robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure to host its components. We need to determine the most appropriate AWS architecture to ensure high availability, performance, security, and compliance with UAE regulations. How should we design our AWS infrastructure to meet these requirements?

## Decision Drivers

- High availability and fault tolerance requirements
- Performance needs for AI components and database operations
- Security and compliance with UAE PDPL regulations
- Scalability to handle growing user base and data volume
- Cost optimization considerations
- Operational efficiency and maintainability

## Considered Options

- Option 1: Traditional EC2-based deployment with load balancers
- Option 2: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and managed services
- Option 3: Container-based architecture using Amazon EKS

## Decision

Chosen option: "Option 3: Container-based architecture using Amazon EKS", because it provides the best balance of scalability, flexibility, and control while enabling efficient deployment and management of our microservices architecture.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Containerization provides consistency across development and production environments
- EKS offers managed Kubernetes with reduced operational overhead
- Horizontal scaling capabilities for handling variable loads
- Support for microservices architecture with clear service boundaries
- Integration with AWS services like RDS, S3, and CloudFront
- Ability to implement infrastructure as code using Terraform

### Negative

- More complex than serverless or traditional architectures
- Requires Kubernetes expertise for maintenance and troubleshooting
- Higher baseline costs compared to serverless options
- Potential for underutilized resources if not properly optimized

## Validation

The implementation will be validated through:
1. Load testing to verify scalability and performance
2. Chaos engineering tests to verify fault tolerance
3. Security assessments to ensure compliance with UAE PDPL
4. Cost analysis compared to alternative architectures

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Traditional EC2-based deployment with load balancers

- Good, because it provides full control over the infrastructure
- Good, because it uses familiar and well-established AWS services
- Good, because it's straightforward to implement and understand
- Bad, because it lacks the flexibility of containerization
- Bad, because it requires more manual scaling and management
- Bad, because it can lead to inconsistencies between environments

### Option 2: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and managed services

- Good, because it minimizes operational overhead
- Good, because it offers automatic scaling with pay-per-use pricing
- Good, because it leverages fully managed AWS services
- Bad, because it has limitations for long-running processes like LLM inference
- Bad, because it may introduce cold start latency for some operations
- Bad, because it provides less control over the underlying infrastructure

### Option 3: Container-based architecture using Amazon EKS

- Good, because it enables consistent deployments across environments
- Good, because it provides a good balance of control and managed services
- Good, because it supports microservices architecture effectively
- Good, because it offers robust scaling and self-healing capabilities
- Neutral, because it requires Kubernetes expertise
- Bad, because it has higher complexity than other options
