## Context and Problem Statement

The Real Estate AI Operating System requires a multilingual chatbot capable of handling conversations in English, Arabic, and French. The chatbot needs to understand user queries about properties, market trends, and investment opportunities, and provide accurate responses while maintaining context across conversation turns. How should we implement this chatbot to ensure robust multilingual support, context awareness, and integration with the rest of the platform?

## Decision Drivers

- Need for multilingual support (EN/AR/FR)
- Requirement for stateful conversations with context retention
- Integration with vector database for property information retrieval
- Scalability to handle multiple concurrent users
- Observability requirements for monitoring and debugging

## Considered Options

- Option 1: Custom chatbot implementation with direct LLM API calls
- Option 2: LangChain with simple sequential chains
- Option 3: LangChain with LangGraph for stateful agent workflows

## Decision

Chosen option: "Option 3: LangChain with LangGraph for stateful agent workflows", because it provides the most comprehensive solution for building a stateful, multilingual chatbot with robust workflow control and observability.

## Consequences

### Positive

- LangGraph provides explicit control over conversation state management
- Built-in support for complex workflows with branching and looping
- First-class streaming support for better user experience
- Integration with Langfuse for observability and tracing
- Ability to implement human-in-the-loop moderation when needed
- Seamless integration with vector stores (pgvector) for property information retrieval

### Negative

- Steeper learning curve compared to simpler approaches
- More complex architecture to maintain
- Potential performance overhead for simple queries
- Dependency on third-party libraries and their update cycles

## Validation

The implementation will be validated through:
1. Automated testing of conversation flows in all supported languages
2. Integration testing with the vector database
3. Performance testing under load
4. Monitoring of conversation success rates and user satisfaction metrics in Langfuse

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Custom chatbot implementation with direct LLM API calls

- Good, because it provides maximum flexibility and control
- Good, because it minimizes external dependencies
- Bad, because it requires building state management from scratch
- Bad, because it lacks built-in tools for workflow management
- Bad, because it would require significant development effort
- Bad, because it would lack standardized observability tools

### Option 2: LangChain with simple sequential chains

- Good, because it's simpler to implement than LangGraph
- Good, because it provides built-in abstractions for LLM interactions
- Good, because it has integrations with vector stores
- Bad, because it lacks robust state management for complex conversations
- Bad, because it has limited support for branching conversation flows
- Bad, because it doesn't provide the same level of control as LangGraph

### Option 3: LangChain with LangGraph for stateful agent workflows

- Good, because it provides explicit state management
- Good, because it supports complex workflows with branching and looping
- Good, because it has first-class streaming support
- Good, because it integrates with Langfuse for observability
- Good, because it allows for human-in-the-loop moderation
- Neutral, because it has a steeper learning curve
- Bad, because it adds complexity to the architecture
