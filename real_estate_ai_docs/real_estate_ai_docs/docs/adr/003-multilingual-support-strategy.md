## Context and Problem Statement

The Real Estate AI Operating System needs to support multiple languages (English, Arabic, and French) to serve the diverse UAE real estate market. We need to determine the most effective approach for implementing multilingual support across the platform, including the chatbot, user interface, and generated content like proposals. How should we implement multilingual capabilities to ensure accurate translations, natural language understanding, and a seamless user experience?

## Decision Drivers

- Need to support English, Arabic, and French
- Requirement for accurate real estate terminology translation
- Performance considerations for real-time interactions
- User experience across different languages
- Maintenance complexity and scalability
- Cost considerations for translation services

## Considered Options

- Option 1: Client-side translation using third-party services (Google Translate API)
- Option 2: Custom-trained domain-specific translation models
- Option 3: Hybrid approach with fastText for language identification and NLLB-200 for translation

## Decision

Chosen option: "Option 3: Hybrid approach with fastText for language identification and NLLB-200 for translation", because it provides the best balance of accuracy, performance, and cost-effectiveness for our multilingual requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive

- fastText provides lightweight and accurate language identification
- NLLB-200 offers high-quality translations for our target languages
- Domain-specific fine-tuning can improve real estate terminology translation
- Reduced latency compared to external API calls
- Lower operational costs compared to third-party translation services
- Greater control over the translation pipeline

### Negative

- Requires maintenance of language models
- Initial effort needed for fine-tuning models on real estate terminology
- Higher computational requirements compared to simple API calls
- Need for continuous evaluation and improvement of translation quality

## Validation

The implementation will be validated through:
1. Automated testing of translation accuracy for real estate terminology
2. User testing with native speakers of each supported language
3. A/B testing of different translation approaches
4. Monitoring of user language preferences and feedback

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Client-side translation using third-party services (Google Translate API)

- Good, because it's easy to implement
- Good, because it leverages continuously improved translation services
- Good, because it requires minimal maintenance
- Bad, because it introduces external API dependencies
- Bad, because it may have higher operational costs at scale
- Bad, because it may not handle real estate terminology accurately
- Bad, because it adds latency for real-time interactions

### Option 2: Custom-trained domain-specific translation models

- Good, because it can be optimized for real estate terminology
- Good, because it offers complete control over the translation pipeline
- Good, because it can operate without external dependencies
- Bad, because it requires significant resources to develop and train
- Bad, because it needs continuous improvement to match commercial solutions
- Bad, because it may not perform as well for general language translation

### Option 3: Hybrid approach with fastText for language identification and NLLB-200 for translation

- Good, because fastText provides efficient language identification
- Good, because NLLB-200 offers high-quality translations for our target languages
- Good, because it can be fine-tuned for real estate terminology
- Good, because it operates without external API dependencies
- Neutral, because it requires some computational resources
- Bad, because it needs maintenance and updates of the models
