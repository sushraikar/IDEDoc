## Decision Makers

- Solution Architect
- DevOps Engineer
- Lead Developer

## Context and Problem Statement

The Real Estate AI Operating System requires a reliable, automated, and consistent deployment process to ensure smooth releases and updates. We need to determine the most appropriate deployment strategy and CI/CD pipeline to maintain high quality, minimize downtime, and enable rapid iteration. How should we design our deployment process to meet these requirements?

## Decision Drivers

- Need for reliable and consistent deployments
- Requirement to minimize downtime during updates
- Support for rapid iteration and feature releases
- Ability to roll back quickly in case of issues
- Maintainability and transparency of the deployment process
- Integration with our Kubernetes-based infrastructure

## Considered Options

- Option 1: Traditional CI/CD with direct deployment to EKS
- Option 2: GitOps approach with GitHub Actions and Argo CD
- Option 3: Blue-Green deployment with manual cutover

## Decision

Chosen option: "Option 2: GitOps approach with GitHub Actions and Argo CD", because it provides a declarative, version-controlled approach to deployments with automated synchronization between Git repositories and the Kubernetes cluster.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Git repository becomes the single source of truth for deployments
- Automated synchronization between Git state and cluster state
- Clear audit trail of all changes through Git history
- Self-healing capabilities through continuous reconciliation
- Simplified rollbacks by reverting to previous Git commits
- Improved security with separation of CI and CD processes

### Negative

- Requires learning and maintaining Argo CD
- Adds complexity compared to direct deployment approaches
- Potential for drift if manual changes are made to the cluster
- Requires careful management of secrets and sensitive information

## Validation

The implementation will be validated through:
1. Testing the complete CI/CD pipeline in a staging environment
2. Simulating failure scenarios and verifying recovery
3. Measuring deployment times and success rates
4. Verifying rollback capabilities

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Traditional CI/CD with direct deployment to EKS

- Good, because it's straightforward to implement
- Good, because it's a familiar approach for many developers
- Good, because it has fewer components to maintain
- Bad, because it lacks the declarative nature of GitOps
- Bad, because it may lead to drift between Git and the deployed state
- Bad, because rollbacks can be more complex

### Option 2: GitOps approach with GitHub Actions and Argo CD

- Good, because it provides a declarative approach to deployments
- Good, because it maintains synchronization between Git and cluster state
- Good, because it offers clear visibility into deployment status
- Good, because it simplifies rollbacks through Git history
- Good, because it separates CI (GitHub Actions) from CD (Argo CD)
- Neutral, because it requires learning Argo CD
- Bad, because it adds another tool to the infrastructure

### Option 3: Blue-Green deployment with manual cutover

- Good, because it minimizes downtime during deployments
- Good, because it allows thorough testing before traffic cutover
- Good, because it provides a simple rollback mechanism
- Bad, because it requires maintaining duplicate environments
- Bad, because manual cutover introduces human error risk
- Bad, because it increases resource costs
